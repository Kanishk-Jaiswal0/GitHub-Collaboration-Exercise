First all members cloned repository into their machines
Then each student made a file named <Student name>.txt
Then made changes into their files and committed into the repository
Then students made changes into other students files
Then we each made new branches and made changes again
Then we created Pull requests and merged the branches into the main branch
Before merging we resolved conflicts
Lastly we each made a file with reflection-<student name> as the name where we wrote how much we learned from this exercise
